Human-Robot Interaction
Recent advancements in AI have revolutionized how robots interact with humans. This includes:

Natural language processing: Enabling communication between humans and robots using spoken or written language.
Collaboration: Allowing robots to work alongside humans in various shared tasks, from manufacturing to healthcare facilities.
The advent of large language models has further enhanced human-robot interaction. These models have significantly improved the ability of robots to understand and respond to complex commands and queries, making interactions more natural and intuitive.
