Embodied AI
Embodied AI, a subset of physical AI, represents a significant leap forward in robotics and artificial intelligence, and enables robots to interact with the physical world in increasingly sophisticated ways.

Autonomous Navigation
One of the primary abilities of embodied AI is autonomous navigation. This allows robots to move independently through various environments, making decisions about their path and avoiding obstacles without human intervention.

Object '''Manipulation'''
Object manipulation is another critical aspect of embodied AI, which includes:

Grasping: The ability to securely hold objects of different shapes and sizes
Complex manipulation: performing intricate tasks, such as assembling components or folding clothes.
These skills enable robots to interact with their environment in ways that closely mimic human capabilities.
